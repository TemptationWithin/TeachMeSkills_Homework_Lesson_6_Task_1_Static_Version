# TeachMeSkills_Homework_Lesson_6_Task_1_Static_Version
1st / 7 Tasks Static Version

* TASK 1
* Imagine that Java does not have a division operator.
* Write a class that will contain methods for dividing one number by
* (we pass only integers to the method input).
* We assume that all other arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) exist, only division is missing.
* The class should contain three methods:
* 1) a method for dividing one number by another without a remainder (for example, 10 divided by 3 -> the method will return 3)
* 2) a method for dividing one number by another with a remainder (for example, 10 divided by 3 -> the method will return 3.333)
* 3) a method that returns only the remainder from dividing one number by another, if there is a remainder
* (for example, 10 divided by 3 -> the method will return 1)
*
* Do this task in two versions (as two separate projects):
* 2) implement these methods as static
*
* What we practice in this task:
* - control structures, branching operations
* - constructing algorithms
* - static methods and when they are used
* - thinking through options for testing code
